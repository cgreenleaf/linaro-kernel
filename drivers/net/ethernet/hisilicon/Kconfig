# HISILICON network device configuration

config NET_VENDOR_HISILICON
	bool "Hisilicon devices"
	depends on ARCH_HIX5HD2 
	default y
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Hisilicon cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_HISILICON

menuconfig HIETH_GMAC
        tristate "Hisilicon GMAC Family Network Device Support"
        default y
        help
          This selects the hieth gmac family network device.
