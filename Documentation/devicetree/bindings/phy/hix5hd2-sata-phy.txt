Hisilicon hix5hd2 SATA PHY
-----------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "hisilicon,hix5hd2-sata-phy"
- reg : a list of offset + length pairs
- #phy-cells: must be 0
Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Optional Properties:
- hisilicon,syscon : phandle of syscon.
- hisilicon,power-reg :offset and bit number of the sata power supply
  register.It's needed when hisilicon,syscon is supplied.
- hisilicon,reg-init : one of more sets of 4 cells.  The first cell
  is the register offset address, the second cell is the start bit in register,
  the third cell means the bit width, and the fourth cell is the value to set.

Example:
	sata_phy: phy@f9900000 {
                        compatible = "hisilicon,hix5hd2-sata-phy";
                        reg = <0xf9900000 0x10000>;
                        #phy-cells = <0>;
			hisilicon,syscon = <&peri_ctrl>;
			hisilicon,power-reg = <0x8 10>;
                        hisilicon,reg-init = <0x148 0 32 0x345cb8>,<0x14c 0 32 0x20545>;
                };
